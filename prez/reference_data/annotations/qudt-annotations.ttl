For example, the meter is a quantity of length that has been rigorously defined and standardized by the BIPM (International Board of Weights and Measures). Any measurement of the length can be expressed as a number multiplied by the unit meter. More formally, the value of a physical quantity Q with respect to a unit (U) is expressed as the scalar multiple of a real number (n) and U, as  \\(Q = nU\\)."^^<http://qudt.org/schema/qudt/LatexString> ;

For example, the 'newton' and the 'joule'. These two are, respectively, the force that causes one kilogram to be accelerated at 1 metre per second per  second, and the work done by 1 newton acting over 1 metre. Being coherent refers to this consistent use of 1. In the old c.g.s. system , with its base units the centimetre and the gram, the corresponding coherent units were the dyne and the erg, respectively the force that causes 1 gram to be accelerated at 1 centimetre per second per second, and the work done by 1 dyne acting over 1 centimetre.

    schema:description """<p class="lm-para">The QUDT, or &quot;Quantity, Unit, Dimension and Type&quot; schema defines the base classes properties, and restrictions used for modeling physical quantities, units of measure, and their dimensions in various measurement systems. The goal of the QUDT ontology is to provide a unified model of, measurable quantities, units for measuring different kinds of quantities, the numerical values of quantities in different units of measure and the data structures and data types used to store and manipulate these objects in software.</p>

<p class="lm-para">Except for unit prefixes, all units are specified in separate vocabularies. Descriptions are provided in both HTML and LaTeX formats. A quantity is a measure of an observable phenomenon, that, when associated with something, becomes a property of that thing; a particular object, event, or physical system. </p>

<p class="lm-para">A quantity has meaning in the context of a measurement (i.e. the thing measured, the measured value, the accuracy of measurement, etc.) whereas the underlying quantity kind is independent of any particular measurement. Thus, length is a quantity kind while the height of a rocket is a specific quantity of length; its magnitude that may be expressed in meters, feet, inches, etc.  Or, as stated at Wikipedia, in the language of measurement, quantities are quantifiable aspects of the world, such as time, distance, velocity, mass, momentum, energy, and weight, and units are used to describe their measure. Many of these quantities are related to each other by various physical laws, and as a result the units of some of the quantities can be expressed as products (or ratios) of powers of other units (e.g., momentum is mass times velocity and velocity is measured in distance divided by time).</p>"""^^rdf:HTML ;

Ratios are not meaningful since 20 Â°C cannot be said to be &quot;twice as hot&quot; as 10 Â°C, nor can multiplication/division be carried out between any two dates directly. However, ratios of differences can be expressed; for example, one difference can be twice another. Interval type variables are sometimes also called &quot;scaled variables&quot;, but the formal mathematical term is an affine space (in this case an affine line).</p>

    schema:description "The ratio type takes its name from the fact that measurement is the estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind (Michell, 1997, 1999). A ratio scale possesses a meaningful (unique and non-arbitrary) zero value. Most measurement in the physical sciences and engineering is done on ratio scales. Examples include mass, length, duration, plane angle, energy and electric charge. In contrast to interval scales, ratios are now meaningful because having a non-arbitrary zero point makes it meaningful to say, for example, that one object has &quot;twice the length&quot; of another (= is &quot;twice as long&quot;). Very informally, many ratio scales can be described as specifying &quot;how much&quot; of something (i.e. an amount or magnitude) or &quot;how many&quot; (a count). The Kelvin temperature scale is a ratio scale because it has a unique, non-arbitrary zero point called absolute zero."^^rdf:HTML ;
